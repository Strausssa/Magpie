Activity 1
1. Can you identify keywords to which your chatbot responds?
-You, that, did, what, why, how, etc.
2. Think of several keywords and the responses they might cause.
-name, ip, real, location and the responses are vage and some are really precis such as ip and location. Some responses are vage with the answers with name and reality by asking you for the answers and giving broad answers because I dont think it knows exactly what to say.
