Exercises

Statement: "I like you" Response is "Why do you like me?""

Statement: "I want fried chicken" Response is "Would you really be happy if you had fried chicken?"

Find an example of when this structure does not work well. How can you improve it?
-"I want you to fight me"
Would you really be happy if you had you to fight me?

I would improve this by having the statement actually put the statements "I want" and "you" in logic order for the question to make sense.
